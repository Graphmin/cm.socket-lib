# Coldmind Sockets: A "Secure" and Simple Node.js Networking Library

CmSocket is a Node.js networking library that provides a simple and secure way to build high-performance client-server applications. The library is built on top of the core `net` module and uses a secure key exchange protocol based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm to establish a shared secret between the client and server. This shared secret is then used to encrypt and decrypt messages exchanged over the socket, providing end-to-end encryption and ensuring the security and confidentiality of the data.

## CmSocketKeyExchange Class

At the core of CmSocket is the `CmSocketKeyExchange` class, which encapsulates the key exchange protocol and provides encryption and decryption methods for messages exchanged over the socket. 

## CmSocketServer and CmSocketClient Classes

The `CmSocketServer` and `CmSocketClient` classes provide an easy-to-use API for building server and client applications respectively. The `CmSocketServer` class allows developers to easily create a server that listens for incoming client connections and handles them securely using the key exchange protocol. The `CmSocketClient` class provides a simple API for connecting to a CmSocket server and exchanging messages securely.

## JSON-Based Messages and Custom Server Applications

CmSocket uses JSON-based messages to communicate between clients and servers, making it easy to build custom server applications tailored to specific needs. The library provides a number of events that can be used to handle client connections, disconnections, and data exchange, making it easy to build a custom server application that meets specific needs.

## Security Considerations

While CmSocket provides reasonable security measures, it is still vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and is not recommended for sensitive applications such as online banking systems.
